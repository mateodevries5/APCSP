	<p>I played volleyball for Piedmont High School this year. We made it to the second round of NCS. I play the position outside and sometimes setter. The season was really fun and I am looking forward to next year.</p>

           <p>I also play baseball a lot. At this particular moment I have a shoulder injury that makes it so I cannot play. Hopefully next year I am more healthy.</p>
